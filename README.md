# Final Report

This is a generic readme file to help you get started. Always reference the provided assignment material and rubric on Canvas. One important aspect of the github repo, is that you should include all the analysis code and files your group used. Once cloned to any computer, the user should be able to re-run your analysis code without needing to rename or reconfigure your files. That's the beauty of open source collaboration with git. 10 pts are awarded for version control and 10 pts are awarded for repository functionality.
